# Registry Expressions (RegEx) 101 Tutorial

**RegEx** OR Regular Expressions define a search pattern that can be used to search specific characters/formats in an input string. This tutorial explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part or component i.e. [#regex-components](https://github.com/DionneNoellaBarretto/16-Regex_Tutorial_Gist/blob/main/gist-template.md#regex-components) of the expression and describing what it does.

## Summary

The following regular expression can be used to verify that user input is a valid email address:

ðŸ‘‰ Matching an Email: `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

**Note:** Each component of this regex has a unique responsibility to make sure that a user enters an email address that begins with an unspecified number of characters preceding the `@` symbol, followed by a domain.

But ***this is not all***, let's proceed with reviewing the following expressions and regex components in detail, in the text to follow:

<table width="100">
<tr>
<td align='center'> <strong>Matching a Hex Value </strong></td>
<td align='center'> <strong>Matching a URL</strong> </td>
<td align='center'> <strong>Matching an HTML Tag</strong></td>

<td align='center' > ðŸ‘‰^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$ </td>
<td align='center'> ðŸ‘‰^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$</td>
<td align='center'> ðŸ‘‰ ^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align='center'> The string must be 6 characters long and start with a '#' followed by lower case letters and/or numbers OR could be 3 characters long and the '#' is followed by only by lower case letters and/or numbers </td>
<td align='center'> The string must start with an 'https://' characters followed by lower case letters any length long, followed by a dot and again followed by lower case letters of length 2 to 6 characters </td>
<td align='center'> The string must start with a "<"(without the quotes) followed by lower case letters of any length followed by a closure brace ">" (without the quotes) and then ultimately appended with a closing tag starting with "< /" (without the quotes and space) and ending with ">" (without the quotes) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align='center'> <em>Example: #00ff00 or #0f0 or #000000 or #123 </em></td>
<td align='center'> <em>Example: https://github.com or https://example.in </em></td>
<td align='center'> <em>Example: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/default.ASP" target="_blank"> Html Tags (includes self closing tags)</a> </em></td>
</tr>

## Regex Components

### Anchors
An *Anchor* symbolized as ^ (beginning anchor) or $ (closing anchor) signifies a string that starts with characters following it.

### Quantifiers
? (used for optional characters) and * symbols are common *Quantifiers* seen in a regex. 

### Grouping Constructs
As patterns within a string search begin to get more complicated, *Grouping Constructs* becomes essential to partition regex using ( ) in order to match only a portion of the string at a time.

***Note:*** In the HTML Example above - Multiple groups are bounded by parentheses like for example ?: is grouped to designate them as non-capturing - So long as ?: is not included regex will keep count of all 'capturing groups' bounded by ( ).

### Backreference Constructs
*Backreference Constructs* allow reference to whatever was matched by previous code in the regex by using 'capturing groups'! 

***Note:*** \1 refers to the first capturing group ; \2 second ; \3 third and so on

### Bracket Expressions
[ ] helps identify which portions of the expression can be any or all of the characters within the *Bracket Expression* 

***Note:*** In the URL Example above - the initial bracket expression, is looking for any digit, or any lower case character a-z, or any "." or "-" & in the last two brackets, any or all of those characters are been looked for.

### Character Classes
\d and \w are commonly used *Character Classes* denoting a match for any single character being a digit and a wildcase search respectively . See above ***Bracket Expression*** for an example.

### The OR Operator
| symbolizes the OR or 'Alternate' operator which essentially performs a either match whatever's to the left or right of the '|'. 

***Note:*** In the HTML example '|' is used to match the opening and closing tags & also self closing tags

### Flags
/ delimits regular expressions and are commonly seen at the beginning and/or at the end and at times after anchors too. This is used to identify search criteria outside of the *Flags* to help mark the expression as global (g), insensitive (i) or multi-line (m).

### Character Escapes
\ is a character escape functionality used to strip any special character and turn it into a literal

***Note:***  \ loses its powers when included in a bracket expression


### Literal
The most basic regular expression consists of a single literal character, such as d in this example. It matches the first occurrence of that character in the string. If the string is "This is dNB", it matches the first d it finds in the string - The fact that this d is in the middle of the string does not matter to the regex engine.

***Note*** d is case sensitive and hence if the string contained DNB instead of dNB 'd' wont settle with a match for this string!
